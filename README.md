In 2010 iceland’s Eyjafjallajokull erupted spewing volcanic ash into the upper atmosphere. Air traffic for 32 European counties where affected. I am going to recreate this problem using a graph. I will establish air routes that require connection flights in northern Europe when I build the graph. After which I will initiate the scenario and use Dijkstra’s Algorithm (And maybe another one) to recalculate the routes. Then I will pull fair costs from an established BST w/ linked lists to give airfare prices before and afterwords.
